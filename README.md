# Timer Bars

TimerBars is a BFA ready fork of [NeedToKnow](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/need-to-know).

As long as the original author isn't around, I'll try to keep this addon updated and working. Bug fixes only.

If you find a bug report it at:

* [https://github.com/endymonium/TimerBars/issues](https://github.com/endymonium/TimerBars/issues)

## How to use

* type `/tbs` or `/timerbars` to unlock
* right click on a bar for configuration menu

## Notable changes

* Removed bars of type "Power": the original implementation was marked as exprimental and to many things changed.
