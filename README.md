# Timer Bars

TimerBars is a BFA read fork of [TimerBars](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/need-to-know).

As long as the original author isn't around, I'll try to keep this addon updated and working. Bug fixes only.

* [https://github.com/endymonium/TimerBars/issues](https://github.com/endymonium/TimerBars/issues)

## Notable changes

* Removed bars of type "Power": the original implementation was marked as exprimental and to many things changed.
